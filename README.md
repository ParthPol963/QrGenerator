The QR Code Generator project you are working on uses Java, Maven, and QRGen (a wrapper for the ZXing library) to create a QR code generator application. This project allows users to convert input text or URLs into QR codes, which can then be scanned by QR code readers. The generated QR codes are saved as PNG files, making them easy to share and use across different platforms.

Features:
Text or URL Input: Converts plain text or URLs into scannable QR codes.
Image Generation: Saves the generated QR codes as PNG image files.
Scalability: It can generate QR codes of varying sizes depending on the input data.

Applications:
Business Cards: Embedding contact details in QR codes.
URLs and Links: Simplifying the process of sharing websites, links, or app download pages.
Event Tickets: QR codes for ticket scanning at events.
Authentication: Used in two-factor authentication systems to verify user identities.
